# ClimaNova
ClimaNova is a weather forecast web app I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to show real-time weather and a 15-day forecast for any city. I added some extra features like voice search, notifications, and even some AI logic that gives smart suggestions based on weather conditions.

This was a personal project to improve my frontend skills and explore how AI can be added to a simple app.

## 🔍 Features

- 🔎 Search for any city to get the current weather
- 📊 15-day forecast display
- 📍 Use your current location to get local weather
- 🧠 AI assistant gives weather-based suggestions (like "carry an umbrella")
- 🗣️ Voice input (you can speak the city name)
- 🔔 Set custom weather alerts (like rain or high temp)
- 📢 The app can read out the weather using speech synthesis
- ❤️ Add cities to your favorites for quick access
- 🔗 Share current weather with others
